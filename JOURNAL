TITLE: Watergirls only
AUTHOR: Maple
DESCRIPTION: A mini keyboard specifically made for watergirlies when playing fireboy and watergirl. Watergirls deserve their own territory and need to keep their hands clean from the regular keyboard.

I decided to make a hack pad alongside with my MUCH more experienced friends and followed the hackpad turtorial: https://hackpad.hackclub.com/guide

<DAY 1: 3 hours>
made my first ever schematic!

Most the time was me trying to figure out all the controls and settings I could play with.... the actual schematic took 20 minutes
Moved on to making it a a PCB board and learned how to route (almost died)

<DAY 2: 2 hours>
I used onshape for my CAD design since it's the program I'm most familiar with and my laptop can't handle anything else. I followed the turtorial for the bottom of my case and learned how to get the right measurements for my buttons. I was thinking about how I wanted to make this project more personalized and came up with the idea of making this hackpad a mini keyboard for watergirl from the game fireboy and watergirl. Naturally, I played around with the spline tool to add some funky lines to imitate water around the buttons.

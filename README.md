# Watergirl mini keyboard
This is my first actual project I've made in Hack Club and it was definitely an experience with lots of confusion and a spinkle of rage (with KiCad). Nonetheless, I'm proud of my itty bitty keyboard for the girls. I've designed the keys to be W, A, D, and SPACE so it can be used to play watergirl in the game fireboy and water girl

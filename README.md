# hack-pad
my very first concept of a plan
decided to make a hack pad alongside with my MUCH more experienced friends and followed the hackpad turtorial: https://hackpad.hackclub.com/guide

<DAY 1: 3 hours>
made my first ever schematic!

Most the time was me trying to figure out all the controls and settings I could play with.... the actual schematic took 20 minutes
Moved on to making it a a PCB board and learned how to route (almost died)
